# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We used forking to get the peer downloads and uploads in parallel.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

The trigger for the buffer overrun bug stems from trying to copy the filename from 
to a local variable without a bound. This is fixed by adding a bound when doing strcpy.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
