The goal of Lab1 is to be able to parse an input sh file into some data structure that we can then use to execute the structure in later parts.
We split the task into smaller managable tasks, which are categorized below.

Task 1.) Read the input into a buffer for us to process. For this part, we just stored the input into a cstring.
Task 2.) Iterating through each character in the buffer we made in step 1, we categorized each set of characters into a stream of keywords.
	 It is important to note that these keywords are not keywords in a language, but important words that will be the building blocks for a command.
Task 3.) Validation. We iterate through the stream of keywords and make sure that the syntax is correct, so that we can convert the keywords into commands.
Task 4.) Converting keywords to commands. We built two stacks, a keyword stack and command stack. As we iterate through the keyword stream
	 we add certain keywords to the keyword stack based on a set precedence in order to make commands.

Notes:
Limitations: We hardcoded a case where if there is a case such as ' ... done\nfalse', the newline is converted to a sequence command. There may be more cases
		in which newlines are converted to sequences which we did not account for.
